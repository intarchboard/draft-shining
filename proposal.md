# Shine of the Internet: program proposal

Over the last year we saw a marked turn in comments about the Internet. Previously most
comments were largely optimistic and depicted the Internet as a wonderful innovation.
The tone recently has changed. Many articles point out shortcomings and risks of the
Internet, from security issues to lack of privacy or consolidation of power by a few
actors. This change in tone is captured by the catch phrase "The Shine Has Come Off
The Internet." Of course, this new tone does not fill the Internet Architecture
Board (IAB) with great joy.

We tried to understand the phenomenon by analyzing a series of articles published by
a variety of sources. After this analysis, we came to believe that the main cause
of the change in public perception is the growing asymmetry between powerful
commercial and government actors and the general public. We also believe that this
asymmetry can be addressed by two different sets of actions: exposing the
asymmetry problem and debating societal responses through the Internet Society,
which the IAB advises; and, analyzing whether asymmetry and consolidation are
due to specific elements of the Internet Architecture, which the IAB could
attempt to correct by working with the IETF.

## Internet Asymmetry and the Internet Society

Asymmetry affects the Internet users in many ways. Large platforms learn a lot
about users, and use that knowledge to select personalized content and
advertisement. Instead of flowing directly, communication between users is now
often filtered through these platforms, with consequences such as filter bubbles.

While individual members of the IAB may have information and opinions about this,
we believe that discussing the effects of asymmetry involves mostly non-technical
issues. This is well in line with work in the Internet Society on Building Trust
in the Internet. The IAB will engage with the Internet Society to develop
programs or actions addressing Internet Asymmetry.

## Internet Asymmetry and the Internet Architecture

Asymmetry is largely a consequence of consolidation, characterized by the
emergence of a small number of dominant actors and platforms. In many cases,
this emergence of dominant actors is an expected consequence of market
forces, as big players benefit from economies of scale and network effects
to grow faster than their competitors. However, the IAB also believes that 
unsolved problems in the Internet architecture may also contribute to
this consolidation.

An often quoted example of unsolved problem is the resilience to distributed
denial of service attacks (DDOS). Criminals can generate DDOS attacks of 
such enormous size that a small service is helpless. This drives concentration
of service provisions to a few very large platforms, because only them
have enough capacity to resist the large DDOS.

Another example is search, for which available distributed algorithms could
hardly scale to the size of the Internet. Companies like Google tackle the
problem by building centralized solutions, developing impressive
technology, investing in very large data centers, and building of course
a very asymmetric relation with their users.

These were just two examples. The IAB program on the causes of Internet Asymmetry
will attempt to list areas in which distributed solutions are missing and
can cause concentration and asymmetry. When solutions can be identified,
the program will initiate work in the IETF to standardize the
coressponding technologies.
