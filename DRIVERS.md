# Drivers of Consolidation and the Unsolved Problems Behind Them

Idea: every driver of consolidation has an unsolved technical problems behind it. For example: the advantages of network scale are amplified by the fact that we do not have a good solution to DDoS, advantages of scale in search are amplified by the fact that we don't know how to do distributed search, and so on.

Look at each of these drivers, try to find the technical factor behind each, flesh this out into a draft (or a part of the consolidation draft?)
